# PTSD
This a clinical trial project to evaluate the effect of Vagal Nerve Stimulation on the levels of stress-related biomarkers in PTSD and healthy subjects

## Linear Mix Model 
- Performed longitudinal analysis on stress-related biomarker data for 40 subjects with 18 timepoints measurement 

- Visualized the distribution of each biomaker on PTSD active, non-PTSD active,  PTSD sham, non-PTSD sham 4 groups

- Constructed mix model for each biomarker regressed on age, sex , treatment, PTSD and baseline biomarker including random effect of each id 

## Principle Component Analysis

- Checked missing pattern of all biomarker and impute missing value
- Conducted PCA on all biomarker at baseline,extract PC1, PC2, PC3 regressed on covariates above

## Exploratory factor analysis 

- Screen test to decide  the number of factor to extract
